\section{Scheme the language}
This section will briefly describe a small portion of the Scheme language that will be used in this workshop.
Before we start a few typographical conventions all text written in a 
\texttt{monospaced font} is either a Scheme keyword or text provided or 
returned from the Scheme interpreters REPL (Read Eval Print Loop), a console 
application that evaluates Scheme expressions as you provide them. The prompt 
of the REPL starts with \texttt{\#;<successfully-evaluated-expression-number>$\texttt{>}$}.
\subsection{Introduction}
Since Scheme is a LISP (LISt Processing) dialect the central syntactical element in the language is the list. But before we dive into lists lets look at Scheme's 'primitive' expressions, that is expression that evaluatet to themselves. In Scheme these are: booleans, numbers, characters, strings and vectors.
\subsection{Boolean values}
Scheme has the boolean values \texttt{\#f} and \texttt{\#t} for false and true 
respectively. In boolean expressions all values except \texttt{\#f} are treated 
as true.
\subsection{Numbers}
Scheme supports the following types of numbers
\begin{itemize}
\item integers with base 2, 8, 10, 16
\begin{lstlisting}
#;5>#b100101
37
#;6>37
37
#;7>#o45
37
#;8>#x25
37
\end{lstlisting}
\item rationals
\begin{lstlisting}
#;9>23/5
23/5
#;10>#x2/23 
2/35
\end{lstlisting}
\item floating point values
\begin{lstlisting}
#;11>1.3552e-12
1.3552e-12 
#;12>.2342
0.2342
\end{lstlisting}
\item complex numbers
\begin{lstlisting}
#;13>1+37i
1+37i
#;14>37@1.7
-4.76724628893441+36.6915979867413i
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Characters}
The syntax for writing characters is somewhat different than most other 
programming languages. Character literals are preceded by the 
\texttt{\#\textbackslash} 
characters.
\begin{lstlisting}
#;15>#\a
#\a
#;16>#\newline
#\newline
#;17>#\Z
#\Z
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Strings}
\begin{lstlisting}
#;18>"Fred Flinstone"
"Fred Flinstone"    
#;19>"Barney Rubbles"
"Barney Rubbles"
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Symbols}
A symbol is like an immutable string for which strings with the same content 
will refer to the same object such that they can be easily compared with 
\texttt{eq?} (essentially pointer comparison).
\begin{lstlisting}
#;20>'Fred
Fred
#;21>(string->symbol "Fred Flinstone")
|Fred Flinstone|
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Other types of objects}
\subsubsection{Lists}
A list is a denoted as a \texttt{'('} followed by elements separated by spaces followed by a \texttt{')'}.
\begin{lstlisting}
#;22>(1 2 3)
Error: call of non-procedure: 1

Call history:

<syntax>	  (1 2 3)
<eval>	  (1 2 3)	<--

\end{lstlisting}
Note that Scheme uses the \texttt{;} as the comment character. In the example output you can see the way scheme interprets lists. The first element of the list is interpreted as a procedure if it is not one of the standard syntactic forms. This interpretation can be circumvented by \texttt{quote}-ing the expression using the \texttt{quote} syntactic form or it's abbreviated form \texttt{'}. An example of this is given below:
\begin{lstlisting}
#;22>(quote (1 2 3))
(1 2 3)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
#;23>'(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
#;24>(+ 1 2 3)
6
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Creating lists}
Lists can be created in several different ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item List literals 
\begin{lstlisting}
#;25>(quote (1 2 3))
(1 2 3)
#;26>'(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
\end{lstlisting}
\item Using the \texttt{list} procedure
\begin{lstlisting}
#;27>(list 1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
\end{lstlisting}
\item Using the \texttt{cons} procedure to construct lists  
\begin{lstlisting}
#;28>(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '())))
(1 2 3)
\end{lstlisting}
The name cons stands for "construct". The \texttt{cons} procedure creates what is known as a cons cell, a pair of pointers. These pointer pairs can be used to create a single linked list where the second part of the pair points to the next element (= cons cell) in a list. The last cons cell of a list points to a distinguished value that is not a pair in our case the empty list \texttt{()}. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Deconstructing lists}
Lists can be deconstructed using the \texttt{car} and \texttt{cdr} procedures. These names stem from the original Lisp implementation in the late 1950's. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{car} short for "Contents of the Address part of Register number" is referred to as \texttt{head} or \texttt{first} in some languages.
\item \texttt{cdr} short for "Contents of the Decrement part of Register number" is referred to as \texttt{tail} or \texttt{rest} in some languages.
\end{itemize} 
\begin{lstlisting}
#;29>(car '(1 2 3))
1
#;30>(cdr '(1 2 3))
(2 3)
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Bindings a.k.a Definitions}
\subsubsection{Top-level Bindings}
\paragraph{Syntax}
The create a top-level binding the \texttt{define} syntactic form is used which in it's most basic form looks like this:
\begin{equation*}
\texttt{(define <variable> <expression>)}
\end{equation*}
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{lstlisting}
#;31>(define fred 37)
#;32>fred
37
#;33>(define barney "Betty")
#;34>barney
"Betty"
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Local Bindings}
So far we have seen a way to define top level bindings, local bindings can be 
introduced using the \texttt{let}, \texttt{let*} and \texttt{letrec} 
syntactical forms each of them will be described below.
\begin{equation*}
\texttt{(let ((name$_{0}$ <expression$_{0}$>) $\dots$ (name$_{n}$ <expression$_{n}$>)) <body>)}
\end{equation*}
\begin{listing}
\begin{lstlisting}
#;35>(let ((a 4) (b 3)) (* a b))
12
(let ((a 4) (b (* a a))) (* a b)) ; $\Rightarrow$
;;Error: unbound variable: a
;;
;;	Call history:
;;
;;	<syntax>	  (let ((a 4) (b (* a a))) (* a b))
;;	<syntax>	  (##core#let ((a 4) (b (* a a))) (* a b))
;;	<syntax>	  (##core#begin (* a b))
;;	<syntax>	  (* a b)
;;	<syntax>	  (* a a)
;;	<eval>	  (* a a)	<--
(let* ((a 4) (b (* a 3))) (* a b)) ; $\Rightarrow$ 48
(letrec (
  (odd? (lambda (x) (if (= x 0) #f (even? (- x 1))))) 
  (even? (lambda (x) (if (= x 0) #t (odd? (- x 1)))))) 
    (odd? 37)) ; $\Rightarrow$ #t
\end{lstlisting}
\end{listing}
As you can see from the interpreter output in a \texttt{let} binding the 
different bindings can not refer to each other. In a \texttt{let*} however the 
bindings are evaluated from left to right and the previous bindings are in the 
scope in the subsequent bindings. The \texttt{letrec} binding can be used to 
define mutually recursive bindings as shown in the example above. The value 
of a \texttt{let} binding is value of the last expression in the body. Of the above 
syntactic forms a \texttt{let} also has a form called the named \texttt{let} 
which lets you express iteration in a succinct manner
\begin{lstlisting}
(let loop ((n 1))
  (if (> n 10)
    '()
    (cons n (loop (+ n 1))))) ; $\Rightarrow$ (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Functions}
In Scheme procedures or functions are first class values as well we'll look at 
them in detail in the next section.
\subsection{Procedures/Functions}
\subsubsection{Creating procedures}
Procedures can be created using the \texttt{lambda} syntactical form. Here lambda refers back to the lambda calculus. About which wikipedia \cite{lambda} has the following information
\begin{quotation}
Lambda calculus (also written as $\lambda$-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. First formulated by Alonzo Church to formalize the concept of effective computability, lambda calculus found early successes in the area of computability theory, such as a negative answer to Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem.
\end{quotation}
\paragraph{Syntax}
The basic syntax of a lambda expression looks like this:
\begin{equation*}
\texttt{(lamdba (par$_{0} \dots$ par$_{n}$) <body>)}
\end{equation*}
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{lstlisting}
(lambda (x) (* x x)) ; $\Rightarrow$ #<procedure (? x)>
((lambda (x) (* x x)) 2) ; $\Rightarrow$ 4 
((lambda (x y) (* x y)) 3 4) ; $\Rightarrow$ 12 
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Applying procedures}
We have already seen examples of applying a procedure to arguments above. There also is a handy function called \texttt{apply} that can be used to apply a procedure to it's arguments.
\begin{lstlisting}
(apply (lambda (x y) (* x y)) '(3 4)) ; $\Rightarrow$ 12
((lambda (x y) 
    (* x y)) 
 (car '(3 4)) (car (cdr '(3 4)))) ; $\Rightarrow$ 12
\end{lstlisting} 
Using \texttt{apply} is sometimes handy because then you don't have to deconstruct the list as you can see in the example above.
\subsection{Conditionals}
\subsubsection{\texttt{if}}
Scheme alse has a number of conditional expressions the simplest of which the 
\texttt{if} form has the following syntax:
\begin{equation*}
    \texttt{(if <expression> <then expression> [<else expression>])}
\end{equation*}
The value of the if expression is the value of 
the expression that gets evaluated depending on the value of the 
\texttt{<expression>}, the else expression is optional. If the 
\texttt{<expression>} evaluates to false and the else expression is missing 
than the value of the if expression is undefined.
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{lstlisting}
(if #t 37 42) ; $\Rightarrow$ 37
(if #f 37 42) ; $\Rightarrow$ 42
(if #f 37) ; evaluates to `nothing` in Chicken Scheme
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{\texttt{cond}}
Scheme also has a syntactic form, \texttt{cond} that can contain multiple 
predicates:
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape]
  (cond ((<predicate>$_{0}$) <expression>$_{0}$) 
        $\vdots$ 
        ((<predicate$_{n}$) <expression>$_{n}$) 
        [(else <expression$_{n+1}$)])
\end{lstlisting}
Each of the predicates gets evaluated in order of appearance the value of the 
\texttt{cond} expression is the value of the expression of the first predicate 
that evaluated to true. A \texttt{cond} expression can have an optional 
\texttt{else} clause that will be evaluated if none of the predicates 
evaluated to true.
\paragraph{Examples}
\begin{lstlisting}
(cond ((= 37 42) "Fred")
      ((< 37 42) "Barney")
      (else "Wilma")) ; $\Rightarrow$ "Barney"
\end{lstlisting}
This concludes our discussion about a very limited but sufficient subset of 
the Scheme programming languages, in the next section we will look at how to 
write tests using the test library.
\section{Testing Scheme code}
\subsection{Writing tests}
The environment we will use already loads the test library by default so all 
we need to look at here is the syntax for writing tests. The test library 
has several functions that can be used to write assertions let's look at some 
examples:
\begin{lstlisting}
(test 37  (+ 33 3)) ; $\Rightarrow$ 
;; (+ 33 3) ......................................... [ ${\color{red}\texttt{FAIL}}$]
;;    expected 37 but got 36
;;FAIL
(test "A test with a nice description" 37 (- 42 4)) ; $\Rightarrow$
;; A test with a nice description ................... [ ${\color{red}\texttt{FAIL}}$]
;;    expected 37 but got 38
;;    (- 42 4)
;;FAIL
(test-assert #f) ; $\Rightarrow$
;; .................................................. [ ${\color{red}\texttt{FAIL}}$]
;;    assertion failed
;;FAIL
(test-assert #t) ; $\Rightarrow$
;;#t ................................................ [ ${\color{green}\texttt{PASS}}$]
;;PASS
(test-error "should result in an error" #f) ; $\Rightarrow$
;;should result in an error ......................... [ ${\color{red}\texttt{FAIL}}$]
;;    expected an error but got #f
;;FAIL
(test-error (1 2)) ; $\Rightarrow$
;;(1 2) ............................................. [ ${\color{green}\texttt{PASS}}$]
;;PASS
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Running tests}
To make running tests easy during this workshop we will be using a 
\texttt{watchr} script that will automatically run our tests when they are 
saved. To start watching the home directory of the fp user for changes, open a 
terminal window clicking on the desktop and selecting Terminal from the menu. 
At the prompt type the following command:
\begin{alltt}
> begin-watching-tests
\end{alltt}
\section{DRY-ing up test code using higher order functions}
During this excercise we will remove some duplication (DRY= Don't Repeat 
Yourself) from test code using higher order functions (functions that take 
other functions as parameters or return funtions as their result). Some code 
for this exercise has been prepared for you in the \texttt{fizzbuzz.scm} file. 
Start by opening it using any of the available editors from the menu. This 
file contains some production and test code that implements the basic fizzbuzz 
kata. The assignment was to create a fizzbuzz function that takes an integer 
and returns `fizz` if the integer is divisible by 3, `buzz` if it is divisible 
by 5, `fizzbuzz` if it is divisible by both 3 and 5 and the integer given as 
input otherwise.
\subsection{Extract `method`}
Remove some of the duplication by extracting a function that takes as 
parameters the input integer and the expected output. This function should 
invoke the test method such that calling this new function executes a 
single test case.
\subsection{Reduce duplication further using \texttt{map}}
Now we will remove even more duplication by using the \texttt{map} and 
\texttt{apply} functions. We saw the \texttt{apply} function in the 
introduction it takes a function and a list as arguments and applies the 
supplied function to the supplied arguments in the list. The \texttt{map} 
function takes a function and a list as at parameters and returns a new list 
consisting of the function applied to each of the elements in the list.
Here is a short example
\begin{lstlisting}
(map (lambda (x) (* x x)) '(1 2 3)) ; $\Rightarrow$ (1 4 9)
\end{lstlisting}
The assignment is to use the \texttt{map} and \texttt{apply} functions to 
rewrite the tests as an applycition of \texttt{map} on a list of test cases.
You should use a \texttt{let} binding to avoid poluting the global namespace.
